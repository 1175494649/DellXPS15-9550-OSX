# Dell XPS 15 - 9550-OSX
This contains my modified files to run OS X 10.11.6 on a Dell XPS 15 Hackintosh. Everything is working (except Suspend to Disk)

Setup compatible with Toshiba 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM and 4K Display. Please donâ€™t use the provided SSDT or DSDT files, they will not work for your system. I removed my SMC (serials).


Follow this guide, if you want to make a working setup on your own: [guide][1]
