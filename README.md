# Dell XPS 15 - 9550-OSX
This contains my modified files to run OS X 10.11.6 on a Dell XPS 15 Hackintosh. Everything is working (except Suspend to Disk)
It also contains my setup for OSX 10.12.2, based on darkhandz chinese tutorial

Setup compatible with Toshiba 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM and 4K Display. Please donâ€™t use the provided SSDT or DSDT files, they will not work for your system. I removed my SMC (serials).
