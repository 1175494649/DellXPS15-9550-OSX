# Dell XPS 15 - 9550-OSX
This branch contains my modified files to run OS X 10.11.6 on a Dell XPS 15 Hackintosh. Everything is working (except Suspend to Disk)

Setup compatible with Toshiba 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM and 4K Display. Please donâ€™t use the provided SSDT or DSDT files, they will not work for your system. I removed my SMC (serials).

Follow my guide, if you want to install Sierra: [guide][2]
